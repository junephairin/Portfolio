        <div class="historyofMB"> During my freshman year of highschool, I took Progrmming I and Programming II.
                              That was when I first discovered my love for coding. However, it didnt happen
                              immediately. I remembered the feeling of anxiousness the second I submitted work to
                              Mark, my progamming teacher. "What if i uploaded the file incorrectly?", 
                              "What if my page turned out to be ugly?", "What if my classmates laugh at my work?".
                              The 14 year old me was very nervous about making mistakes and getting laughed at 
                              by my computer skills. But not long after, these kinds of thoughts turned into 
                              "I hope i did it correctly", "I can't wait until my classmates see it", and 
                              "I'm excited for tomorrow". Improvement huh? Little my little, I started to like
                              programming even more. And now here i am. sitting behind my lenovo Yoga. making
                              my own portfolio. below are the files that i have created, that made me who I am 
                              today. a crappy coder. no I'm just kidding. These files made me improve a LOT on my 
                              skills and gave me hope. I give you no guarantees that you will find it all pretty
                              and remarkable, but.. Enjoy :)
